Software development-
1) Frontend - The stuff that you see and interect with: HTML, CSS and JS
2) Backend - everything else
3) UIX designer 

Frontend classified into three types (the one we are learning for now) - the visible part of web pages you can see
Html - hypertext markup language (it is not a programming language but a markup language for web pages) - it describes what a website will look like
It defines the structure of a webpage

Css - cascarding style sheet (used to beautify web pages). 
It decribes the style of HTML eg make all the text purple, give the first image yellow boarder

Javascript stands alone. it is the main programming language of frontend.
JS adds logic and interactivity to a page. eg: do some maths, chnage color when the user clicks, load new data from twitter. it is the actions of a webpage.
- HTML and CSS only create the structure and style of a webpage, but JavaScript adds life by making the page interactive and dynamic.

the html is divided into head and body part
features of HTML
`Tag - eg:<hi></h1>
`Element - tag+content. eg:<hi>This is my first tag</h1>

Difference between Block display type and inline display element:
Block elements take up the full width, start on a new line, and allow setting width and height (e.g., <div>, <p>, <h>).
it does not accomodate anybody, it takes 100% of its width

Inline elements only take up as much space as their content, stay in line with other elements, and donâ€™t allow setting width or height (e.g., <span>, <a>).

What is self enclosing tag? it does not have a closing tag. Eg: <br/, <img


- Heading - <hi>-<h6>
- Paragraph - <p> or <span>
- Bold - <strong> or <b>
- Italicize (italics) - <em> or <i>
- List (numbering) - <ol> or <ul> and then add <li> in between <ol>&</ol>. 
<ol> is for numbers while <ul> is for bullet points.
- Breaking point - <br>
- Dividing - <div>
- Comment - <!-- or control /
- Group small parts of text or elements  - <span>
- Subcript text - <sub>
- Superscript text - <sup>

CSS - Cascarding style sheet
We have three ways of using CSS:
1. Inline styling
2. Internal styling
3. External styling

Inline - is a way we style our HTML document inside the HTML tag. you can only style the body
Internal - all the styling is done in the head tag, you introduce {} to tell it which tag you are trying to style
External - this is where you create a new file for css and linking it to the HTML. you dont need to introduce 'style' because its already saved as css. Just do your thing on the css file, 
then go to HTML and link it using 'link' tag.

its preferable to use external styling to make your html not to be bulky.

Things you need to know in CSS
Note: 16px = 1rem. 
- px means Pixel
- rem means Root em
In CSS, px (pixels) are a fixed, absolute unit of measurement, while rem (root em) is a relative unit tied to the font size of the root element (usually the <html> element). 
Essentially, 1rem is equal to the root element's font size, which is typically 16px by default. 
This means that 16px = 1rem in most browsers, but the rem value can change if the root font size is modified. 
- vw means Width 
- vh means height
- % - This is mostly used for height and width. It is advisible to use %
The difference between vw/vh and % is vw/vh are useful for responsive designs where you want elements to scale directly with the browser window size.
% is useful for creating layouts where elements' sizes are dependent on their containing elements.
- Padding - padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
- Margin - to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders
Difference between padding and margin is Margin is the space outside of a page element. Padding defines the space surrounding content within a web element. 
Margin controls the distance between separate elements on the page. Padding sets the distance between the content and the borders of its containing element.

You can choose to write it in shorthand where two sides are equal like padding 100px 50px where 100px is for top and botton, 50px is for left and right
or shorthand where it is displayed in four sides like this = padding 10px 20px 30px 40px, where 10px is for top 20px for right, 30px for bottom, 40px for left because it moves in clockwise direction
or like this - padding-right, padding-left, padding-top, padding-bottom
